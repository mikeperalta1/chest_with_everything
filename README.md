# Chest With Everything
Lightweight and game-agnostic mod which adds a chest node containing every single node, item and tool registered (with exception for ones in the `not_in_creative_inventory` group) inside. Useful for development purposes in games written from scratch or for server operators.

Based off of Development Test's "Chest of Everything" mod.
